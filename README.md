**[Clique Percolation Method Implementation](https://github.com/marcushaddon/go-clique-perc)**

A programming assignment for a job interview. The instructions were to find maximal cliques in an undirected graph using the [Clique Percolation Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_percolation_method) in Go.


**[Byte Painter](https://github.com/marcushaddon/byte-painter)**

An assignment given to me as part of the hiring process for my previous job. The instructions were to create a web socket server that, when connected to would respond with 1kb of random binary data. An accompanying web page would connect to the server, and for each bit in the random data, draw a white pixel onto an HTML canvas element for each bit set to 1 and a black pixel for each bit set to 0.
